## Setup firebase database

    export var masterFirebaseConfig = {

      apiKey: "xxxx",

      authDomain: "xxxx.firebaseapp.com",

      databaseURL: "https://xxxx.firebaseio.com",

      storageBucket: "xxxx.appspot.com",

      messagingSenderId: "xxxx"

    };

## Planning

* Access a list of the cold calls I have made for my sales.
* Filter/organize these phone calls based on the date(month) or the city/town client is located.
* Search for the name of client/person to, for instance, find out if I have called that person in the past or find out how the call went.
* Search for the name of client/person to, for instance, find out if I have called that person in the past or find out how the call went.
* Check on the details of a phone call: the name of the agency or agent, their phone numbers, a description of the result of the conversation (for example, folllow-up call, a call that got me an appointment, call with no answer, etc.), the date of the conversation, the city/place client is located and the number of points I scored with this cold call.
* Log in a new cold call with the details and assign it a number of points (for my points rewards system).
* Alert/reminder of the follow-up calls I must make that day.
* Check how many points I have gotten so far.
